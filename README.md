# Candy Crush Clone - Computer Graphics Final Project


..
## A game base on Candy Crush Saga, project written in C# and Unity showing how to apply Computer Graphics theory.

Welcome to our exciting project, where we aim to develop a captivating match-three puzzle game inspired by the popular Candy Crush Saga. We will be harnessing the power of Unity, a robust and widely-used game development engine, coupled with C#, a versatile and object-oriented programming language. Our goal is to create an engaging, visually appealing game that offers a variety of levels and challenges to keep players entertained. We believe that by using C# in conjunction with Unity's comprehensive suite of tools, we can bring our vision of a dynamic, addictive, and fun-filled game to life.
